== Sample AsciiDoc

=== Use comments

 // One Line

 ////
 Lots
 of
 Comments
 ////



=== Headlines

Use = for the headlines, because you see easily the structure

----
= Document Title
== 1 headline for Chapter
=== 2 headline for Subchapter
==== 3 headline
----



=== Listing Block for commands within the text

ONLY use the style of "listing" block, NO OTHER

 ----
 example command
 ----

----
example command
----

Do NOT use the optional title for the block, nor styles to conflict with DAPS.



=== Variables

Make use of variables to have global substitutions ... can be imbedded in the same AsciiDoc file or via include functions

:myVariable: ThisIsTheContent
Declaration

 :myVariable: ThisIsTheContent

Usage

 {myVariable}

{myVariable}

Usage within listing blocks needs to be allowed as normally listing provides text "as it is"

 [subs="attributes"]
 ----
 {myVariable}
 ----

[subs="attributes"]
----
{myVariable}
----

or if you want also formatting

 [subs="attributes,quotes"]
 ----
 this is some text and **{myVariable}**
 ----

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
this is some text and **{myVariable}**
----

Sometimes you need double formatting characters:
double asterisks around one or more **l**etters in a word make those letters bold which you also need inside of blocks



=== Inclusion of other documents 

Usage

 include::sample-include.adoc[]

include::sample-include.adoc[]

DON'T use headlines in these include files, leave the headline placeholders in your main document

// There is a command for that , but i did not tried it out :leveloffset: 1   -> pushes titles down one level



=== Inclusion of images

 image::sample.png[]
 image::sample.svg[]

image::sample.png[]
image::sample.svg[]

Images needs to be in the subdirectory ./images if you would like to use DAPS relative to your document. You can also add metadata, like titles, scaling, etc.



=== Conditionals 

Ability to adjust content based upon

* a defined variable, like providing paths to view images on line if using GitHub via browser (can also do the contrary via ifndef)

 ifdef::env-github[]
 :imagesdir: https://github.com/bwgartner/suse-doc/blob/master/AsciiDoc/images/src/png/
 endif::[]

* or based upon their values

 ifeval::["{myVariable}" == "ThisIsTheContent"]
 TaDa !
 endif::[]

ifeval::["{myVariable}" == "ThisIsTheContent"]
Tada !
endif::[]

* or based upon ADOCATTRIBUTES (see [DC-sample](../DC-sample). If this were commented out the DC file, then the include would not happen.

// == Do not use the . style for Paragraphs
// .text text

// as it destroys all other formatting with DAPS
// even if they work well in asciidoc direct output



=== Useful denotation/callout paragraphs with icons
Which could also as multi-line block

There are more very flexible and other possibilities for tables
